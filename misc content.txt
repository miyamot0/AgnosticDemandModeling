The considerable influence of near-zero values and relative error are described well in @koff2015expt. As noted in that work, the replacement of zero values with *arbitrary* constants led to wildly varying effects on fits using the @hursh2008economic framework. Indeed, most agree that constructing a common $A_{Lower}$ (e.g., for all demand series) with a small constant (e.g., 0.1, 0.01) is unfavorable. The authors highlight issues with applying an *arbitrary* constant to zero-valued consumption and used this logic to make a case for a restatement of the @hursh2008economic model in linear terms. The desire to include all data, zero-valued or not, is admirable and statistically desirable but two issues warrant noting in this approach.

First, the evaluation of *arbitrary* constants is fundamentally at odds with how individual demand curves and span constants interact to determine the demand curve, see \autoref{fig:fig1CurveSpanEmpirical}. That is, $Q_{0}$ forms the basis for $A_{Upper}$ and the arbitrary constant (in log scale) differ from $A_{Lower}$ by several magnitudes. This is because $A_{Upper}$ and $A_{Lower}$ are jointly determined by individual-level parameters and the global span constant $k$. As such, replacing *all* zero values with a common constant simply does not provide a reasonable approximation of $A_{Upper}$.

Second, neither the @hursh2008economic nor the @koff2015expt models characterize demand at zero. Although the @hursh2008economic fails for obvious reasons, the limitations of the @koff2015expt approach are less self-evident. Specifically, regression in the @koff2015expt approach succeeds in the case of 0 value consumption because 0 values *are treated as* $A_{Lower}$, which is a bound determined by individual-level $Q_{0}$ values and the span parameter $k$. As such, this strategy succeeds because 0 values are approximated by individual-level $A_{Upper}$ bounds and because the absolute difference $A_{Upper}$ decreases by an order of magnitude for each unit increase in parameter $k$. As such, the @koff2015expt approach is essentially equivalent to using the @hursh2008economic with individually-derived constants and normally distributed error in the linear scale. However, this claim is not trivial and simulation and analysis is warranted to whether the two models differ in an appreciable manner.
